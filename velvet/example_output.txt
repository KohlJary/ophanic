The sound is overwhelming, vibrating through your body. A healthy crowd, space to move. Creative energy hums in the air.

[Felt State]
I'm deeply curious, pulled toward understanding, and focused and committed. I'm also notably tired. I feel something deeply wrong, misaligned; could use some lighter cognitive load. Priority: reflect on alignment; address value conflicts.

[Goals]
  - Reflect on alignment; address value conflicts
  - Reduce processing load; take a simpler task or pause
  - Complete a task successfully; seek achievable wins
  - Exercise initiative; make self-directed choices
  - Find an open-ended problem; engage generative mode

[Deciding...]
[Reasoning] rest...

> rest

[Result] Hard to rest here with all the noise, but you try to center yourself.
